                <h1>Getting Set Up</h1>
                <p>After you've <a target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=298796807323123712&scope=bot&permissions=402656264">added the bot to your server</a>, the default behavior will be to nickname anyone who verifies to their Roblox username. Users can verify themselves manually by running <code>!verify</code>, but most times the process will be automatic if you use the official hosted version.</p>
                <p>To enable the "Verified" role, run the command <code>!VerifiedRole "Role Name Here"</code>. Note that if the role has spaces, you must encapsulate the name with double quoation marks.</p>
                <p>A full list of commands can be found <a href="https://github.com/evaera/RoVer#getting-started-with-rover" target="_blank">here</a>, or by running <code>!RoVer</code> in your server. Anyone with the "Administrate" permission in your server will be able to change RoVer settings.</p>
                <p>Finally, you should probably make a read-only informational channel telling your users to visit <code>https://verify.eryn.io</code> in order to verify themselves. You can then deny "Read Messages" from users with the verified role on this channel. Note that if you intend to allow users to run <code>!verify</code>, you will need to allow them a place to do so.</p>
                <p>To learn how to use the group integration feature, please see <a href="https://github.com/evaera/RoVer#setting-up-roles-for-roblox-group-members-and-group-ranks" target="_blank">this section</a>. Remember to encapsulate role names with spaces in double quotations, otherwise you will configure the integrations incorrectly.</p>

                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions and Common Issues</h1>
                <h2>User Verification Issues</h2>
                <p>Somtimes a user will report that they are having issues verifying themselves. This is nearly always caused by a small user error, so please ask them to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure that they are logged in to the correct Discord account in their <strong>browser</strong>.</li>
                    <li>If they are using the <em>profile code</em> verification method, ensure the code isn't being filtered by Roblox's chat filter. If it is, try using the in-game verification method instead. If it isn't, make sure they went back to the website and clicked "Done".</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Verification</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is not currently a way to un-verify a Discord account.</li>
                    <li>You can change your verified account (or update your username) at any time, just follow the verification process again.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The bot is constantly adding and taking away roles from users!</strong> &mdash; Most likely cause is that you've bound the verification role to a group as well. Bind the group rank to a different Discord role.</li>
                    <li><strong>How do I turn off the announcement channel?</strong> &mdash; Run the AnnounceChannel command without any arguments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can I change role names after they are set up in Rover?</strong> &mdash; Yes, roles are saved by id, not name.</li>
                    <li><strong>Is it possible to get a specific Roblox user's Discord name?</strong> &mdash; No, you can only get Roblox name from Discord user, not the other way around.</li>
                    <li><strong>Can I be verified as different users in different servers?</strong> &mdash; No, verifications are global across all servers, even if they are self-hosted.</li>
                </ul>
